# 1.9 String Anagrams (hard)

**Problem:**

&#x20;    ****     [438**.** Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)



Given two strings `s` and `p`, return _an array of all the start indices of_ `p`_'s anagrams in_ `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
* `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.
